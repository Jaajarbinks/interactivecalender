# Interactive Day Planner

I made an Interactive Day Planner
I want it to be able to tell someone what the current time and date is at the top.
Then i want the time slots to be past time one color and present time to be a color and the future time to be another color
I want to make the text area to be able to hold a value and to save to the local storage.On refresh I want the text to be able to stay where it is typed.
